        Return a list of orders. Each order is a string, with specific format. For the format, read the game rule and game engine documentation.
        
        Expected format:
        A LON H                  # Army at LON holds
        F IRI - MAO              # Fleet at IRI moves to MAO (and attack)
        A WAL S F LON            # Army at WAL supports Fleet at LON (and hold)
        F NTH S A EDI - YOR      # Fleet at NTH supports Army at EDI to move to YOR
        F NWG C A NWY - EDI      # Fleet at NWG convoys Army at NWY to EDI
        A NWY - EDI VIA          # Army at NWY moves to EDI via convoy
        A WAL R LON              # Army at WAL retreats to LON
        A LON D                  # Disband Army at LON
        A LON B                  # Build Army at LON
        F EDI B                  # Build Fleet at EDI

        Note: If an invalid order is sent to the engine, it will be accepted but with a result of 'void' (no effect).
        Note: For a 'support' action, two orders are needed, one for the supporter and one for the supportee. (Same for 'convoy')
        Note: For each unit, if no order is given, it will 'hold' by default.

        Useful Functions:
        
        # This is a dict of all the possible orders for each unit at each location (for all powers).
        possible_orders = self.game.get_all_possible_orders()

        # This is a list of all orderable locations for the power you control.
        orderable_locations = self.game.get_orderable_locations(self.power_name)
    
        # Combining these two, you can have the full action space for the power you control.

        # You can re-use the build_map_graphs function in the GreedyAgent to build the connection graph of the map if needed.
